#+title: Readme

My attempt to a quantified life. It currently holds two repositories:
- Reloj: Holds code to ingest data from my xiaomi smart band. Converts to parquet files.
- activity-watcher: Ingest from ActivityWatcher database to parquet file. Maybe requires refactoring for working with the new AW database format.
